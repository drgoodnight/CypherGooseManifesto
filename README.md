# A Cyphergoose's Manifesto

This little project on Ordinals was inspired by the cypherpunk movement and a derivative of the cypherpunk lab cypherpunk manifesto located [here](https://github.com/cypherpunklab/manifesto).
Dmitri Cherniak's recently published goose generator. I am approaching these
subjects in a fun and combinatory way by merging the one of the most important topics
in life "freedom & privacy" with a meme "Geese by Cherniak".

- 1st step: download and inscribe the HTML file containing the `A Cyphergoose's Manifesto`
  [here](https://github.com/drgoodnight/CypherGooseManifesto/blob/master/manifesto.html)
- 2nd step: it must be inscribed by block 813948 
- 3rd and last step: Enjoy the reading of `A Cyphergoose's Manifesto`


These can be indexed based on the hash of the HTML file. If you want to see if yours is valid run the following command in the terminal with the inscriptionId of your HTML file.

```
node validate.js <inscriptionId>
```
